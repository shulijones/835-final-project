jonsh and caragay's 6.835 final project: Picture Hanging Helper

To run the app, clone or otherwise download the code. Open two command line instances. On one, go to the frontend folder and run `npm run serve`. On the other, go to the backend folder and run `python app.py`. To see the app, go to the localhost port that the frontend is running. (Note: the code expects the frontend to be running on port 8080 and the backend to be running on port 5000.)
